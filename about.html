              <hr />
              <p>
                Megan is a selfless 23 year old woman from North Platte Nebraska
                who has aspirations of inventing countless products that benefit
                millions of people. Megan has a small family that consists of
                her husband, herself, and their dog. Currently she works as a
                part time secretary while she attends Mid Plains Community
                College full time. In the summer semester of 2024, she plans to
                transfer her studies to Arizona State University, where she will
                study mechanical engineering full time. When she completes her
                studies, she hopes to land an engineering job at a product
                development/product testing company so she can learn the
                engineering best practices that will help her get closer to
                reaching her goals. In her free time Megan enjoys painting her
                nails, as well as others nails, as a form of artistic
                expression. She also enjoys taking part in active activities to
                stay fit, such as running, in an effort to remain in good
                health. One of Megan's goals for 2023 was to travel more because
                it is something that she enjoys doing often. She met this goal
                and ended up traveling to California five times, Hawaii once,
                Missouri once, Texas once, and Virginia once all in 2023. In
                2024 Megan has goals of keeping high grades in the upper level
                math classes that she is assigned to do as a part of her
                curriculum, lose 10 pounds, traveling more with aspirations of
                possibly going out of the country to Europe, and lastly she is
                preparing to hopefully finish a marathon that takes place in
                march.
